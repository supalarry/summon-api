// This file is used by jest.config.js to set up environment variables
// within tests. Usually, you would set up environment variables as follows:
// URL=https://google.com
// but here you have to prepend process.env in front of it for it to work in tests:
// process.env.URL=https://google.com

process.env.EXAMPLE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE = 'All tests green. Easy.';
